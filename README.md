Grade Calculator, Version 3

December 21, 2018

This calculator helps me keep track of my grades in classes. It stores information about past grades (a description of the grade, such as “Test 1” or “Term Project”; the grade I received, like 89.6%; and the assignment’s weight as percentage, such as 15%). The grade calculator calculates my overall grade in the course and allows me to run “what-if” calculations. (A what-if calculation tells me what grade I’ll need on remaining assignments in the course in order to finish with a specified grade; it also reports what grade I’ll have overall if I make a certain grade on remaining assignments.) Finally, there is section in the calculator for finding my GPA. This section shows me what GPA I’ll have overall, given certain grades on up to six classes. Another screen allows me to store the final (letter) grades of completed courses.
